Networking Evolved\n\n\n\n -->\nLibSourcey is a collection of cross platform C++11 modules and classes that provide developers with an arsenal for rapidly developing high performance network based p2p and media streaming applications. Think of it as the power of libuv combined with the features of FFmpeg, OpenCV and WebRTC, all integrated with the ease and readability of the stl (C++ Standard Library).\n\nDocumentation: http://sourcey.com/libsourcey  \nRepository: https://github.com/sourcey/libsourcey  \nLicence: LGPL-2.1+\n\nFeatures\n\nEvent-based IO â€” Core modules are built on top of libuv (the underlying C library that powers Node.js) and use event-based asynchronous IO throughout to maximise performance and minimise concurrency reliance for building mission critical native and server side apps.\n\nCross platform â€” The codebase is cross platform and should compile on any system with access to a modern C++11 compiler.\n\nModular libraries â€” Libraries are modular for easy integration into your existing projects, so you can just \"include what you need\" without incurring extra incumbent bloat.\n\nClean and readable code â€” Modern C++ design principles have been adhered to throughout for clear and readable code.\n\nNetworking layer â€” A solid network layer is absolutely essential. The networking layer contains TCP, SSL and UDP socket implementations that combine libuv under the hood for blazing fast networking, and openssl for security and encryption.\n\nMedia streaming and encoding â€” The av library consists of thin wrappers around FFmpeg and OpenCV for media capture, encoding, recording, streaming, analysis and more.\n\nWeb servers and clients â€” A HTTP stack is provided that includes servers, clients, WebSockets, media streaming, file transfers, and authentication. The HTTP parser is based on the super-fast C code used by nginx.\n\nRealtime messaging â€” LibSourcey aims to bridge the gap between desktop, mobile and web by providing performance oriented messaging solutions that work across all platforms.\n\nSocket.IO â€” Socket.IO C++ client that supports the latest protocol revision 4 (>= 1.0). Read more about Socket.IO.\nSymple â€” Sourcey's home grown realtime messaging protocol that works over the top of Socket.IO to provide rostering, presence and many other features necessary for building online games and chat applications. More about Symple.\n\n\nWebRTC support â€” WebRTC native support allows you to build p2p desktop and server side applications that inherit LibSourcey's realtime messaging and media capabilities. Take a look at the examples for how to stream live webcam and microphone streams to the browser, and also how to record live WebRTC streams on the server side.\n\nFull ICE stack â€” The ICE module is a complete implementation of RFC 5245 (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) based on LibSourcey architecture.\n\nICE â€” RFC 5245 ICE agent implementation.\nSTUN â€” RFC 5389 implementation that includes support for ICE and TURN and TURN TCP messages.\nTURN â€” Server and client stack that supports both RFC 5766 (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) and RFC 6062 (Traversal Using Relays around NAT Extensions for TCP Allocations) specifications.\nSDP â€” RFC 4566 implementation that includes extra support for ICE headers.\n\n\n\nExample\nA good starting point is the PacketStream, which lets you create a dynamic delegate chain for piping, processing and outputting arbitrary data packets. This method of layering packet processors and dynamic functionality makes it possible to develop complex data processing applications quickly and easily.\nFor example, this is how you would capture a live webcam stream, encode it into H.264, and broadcast it in realtime over the internet:\n// Create a PacketStream to pass packets from the\n// input device captures => encoder => socket\nPacketStream stream;\n\n// Setup the encoder options\nav::EncoderOptions options;\noptions.oformat = av::Format(\"MP4\", \"mp4\",\n    av::VideoCodec(\"H.264\", \"libx264\", 400, 300, 25, 48000, 128000, \"yuv420p\"),\n    av::AudioCodec(\"AAC\", \"libfdk_aac\", 2, 44100, 64000, \"s16\"));\n\n// Create a device manager instance to enumerate system devices\nav::DeviceManager devman;\nav::Device device;\n\n// Create and attach the default video capture\nav::VideoCapture::Ptr video;\nif (devman.getDefaultCamera(device)) {\n    video.open(device.id, 640, 480, 30);\n    video.getEncoderFormat(options.iformat);\n    stream.attachSource(video, true);\n}\n\n// Create and attach the default audio capture\nav::AudioCapture::Ptr audio;\nif (devman.getDefaultMicrophone(device)) {\n    audio.open(device.id, 2, 44100);\n    audio.getEncoderFormat(options.iformat);\n    stream.attachSource(audio, true);\n}\n\n// Create and attach the multiplex encoder\nav::MultiplexPacketEncoder::Ptr encoder(options);\nstream.attach(encoder);\n\n// Attach the output net::Socket instance (instantiated elsewhere)\n// to broadcast encoded packets over the network\nstream.attach(socket);\n\n// Start the stream\n// This method call will start the device captures and begin\n// pumping encoded media into the output socket\nstream.start();\n\nThere are plenty more demos and sample code to play with over on the examples page.\nInstallation\nSee the platform independent installation guides.\nContributors\nA BIG thanks to everyone who has contributed to the development of LibSourcey so far:\n\nKam Low (@auscaster) â€” Primary developer\nYury Shulbn (@yuryshubin) â€” iOS build toolchain and platform fixes\nVinci Xu (@VinciShark) â€” Windows documentation, testing and updates\nMichael Fig (@michael-fig) â€” Fixed compiler flags to build without FFmpeg\nHyunuk Kim (@surinkim) â€” Fixed std::codecvt unicode character conversion on Windows\nDamian Zelim (@ZelimDamian) â€” Fixed compiler flags for OS X build\n\nContributing\nPull Requests are always welcome, so if you make any improvements please feel free to float them back upstream :)\n\nFork LibSourcey on Github\nCreate your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)\nCommit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature')\nPush to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)\nCreate new Pull Request\n\n\n"},"getting-started.html":{"url":"getting-started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\nFirst things first, welcome to LibSourcey, and it's great to have you along for the ride! We've done our best to make the docs as clear as possible to save you time, so if something's missing or changed, or newer versions are available then please let us know or even better submit a PR with your updates.\nBefore going any further please make sure LibSourcey is compiled and installed on your system.\nOnce LibSourcey is installed you a number of choices how you include the libraries in your own project:\n1) Using pkg-config (Linux only)\nUsing pkg-config is the simplest and easiest method to include LibSourcey libraries and headers in your project. After running make install the pkg-config script is located in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/libsourcey.pc by default.\nUsing the default structure you can include Libsourcey in your project like so (using gcc):\ngcc -o test test.cpp $(pkg-config --libs --cflags libsourcey)\n\n2) Using CMake\nIf you're already using CMake in your own project then including LibSourcey with CMake is highly recommended. Once you have built and installed LibSourcey you can include all the libraries and headers by adding the following lines to your CMakeLists.txt:\n# The LibSourcey root directory must be set\nset(LibSourcey_ROOT_DIR \"\" CACHE STRING \"Where is the LibSourcey root directory located?\")\nfind_package_handle_standard_args(${module} DEFAULT_MSG LibSourcey_ROOT_DIR)\n\n# Tell CMake where to locate the LibSourcey .cmake files\nset(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} ${LibSourcey_ROOT_DIR}/cmake)\nset(CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH ${CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH} ${LibSourcey_ROOT_DIR}/cmake)\n\n# Include LibSourcey with specified modules (example: uv base net crypto http)\nfind_package(LibSourcey COMPONENTS uv base net crypto http REQUIRED)\n3) Extending the build system\nThe third option is to include the LibSourcey CMake build system in your own project. When you choose this option you will be building LibSourcey modules along side your own project as dependencies, and will also inherit the LibSorucey build system (which is pretty awesome). See here for a complete list of build options.\nThis method is only recommended for advanced users and if you want your project to be tightly coupled with LibSourcey.\nBelow is an example of a full CMakeLists.txt file that you can use to include LibSourcey in your build tree:\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.10)\nproject(exampleapp)\n\n# Set the source directory and search locations as required for your project\nset(sourcedir src)\nset(sourcefiles ${sourcedir}/*.cpp)\nset(headerfiles ${sourcedir}/*.h)\n\n# Include LibSourcey\ninclude(\"../libsourcey/LibSourcey.cmake\")\ninclude_directories(${Libourcey_INCLUDE_DIRS})\n\nlink_libraries(${LibSourcey_LIBRARIES})\ninclude_directories(${sourcedir} ${LibSourcey_INCLUDE_DIRS})\n\n# Glob your sources and headers\n# Be sure to modify the search paths according to your project structure\nfile(GLOB_RECURSE sources ${sourcefiles})\nfile(GLOB_RECURSE headers ${headerfiles})\n\nadd_executable(exampleapp ${sources} ${headers})\ninstall(TARGETS exampleapp)\nNext Steps\nOnce LibSourcey is included in your project you're ready to start using the API. Check out the code examples, and API reference to start cutting code.\n"},"installation.html":{"url":"installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Installation\nLibSourcey uses

14.04, although installation should be fairly portable across most flavors of Linux.\nInstall Dependencies\nBefore doing anything make sure you have the core dependencies installed:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config git cmake openssl libssl-dev\n\n\n\nInstall FFmpeg (optional):\nFFmpeg is an optional but recommended dependency that's required to make use of LibSourcey's media encoding capabilities.\nMost versions on Linux have FFmpeg development libraries that you can install directly from the package manager. If you're on a newer version of Ubuntu (>= 15.04) then you can install the required libraries as follows:\nsudo apt-get install --yes libavcodec-ffmpeg-dev libavdevice-ffmpeg-dev libavfilter-ffmpeg-dev libavformat-ffmpeg-dev libswresample-ffmpeg-dev libpostproc-ffmpeg-dev\n\nOtherwise if you want to compile FFmpeg yourself you can follow the official guide for installing FFmpeg that works out of the box with LibSourcey.\n /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opencv.conf'\nsudo ldconfig\n~~~\n-->\nInstall WebRTC (optional):\nInstalling WebRTC can be tricky and time consuming, but using the script below you should be able to get started without a hitch. Using the script is highly recommended as there are a few caveats to take note of when compiling WebRTC for use with LibSourcey:\n\nRTTI must be enabled (the -no_rtti compiler flag must be removed)\nThe WebRTC static library must not contain JsonCpp (it conflicts with our newer internal version)\nlibstdc++ iterator debugging must be disabled or it conflicts with external dependencies compiled without it (ninja build must set enable_iterator_debugging=false)\n\ncd ~/tmp\ngit clone git@github.com:sourcey/webrtcbuilds.git\ncd webrtcbuilds\n./build.sh -l jsoncpp -e\n\nInstall LibSourcey\ncd ~/tmp\ngit clone https://github.com/sourcey/libsourcey.git\ncd libsourcey\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE # extra cmake commands here, see below for a full list...\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nAll done!\nSee here for a complete list of build options.\n"},"installation-osx.html":{"url":"installation-osx.html","title":"OS X Guide","keywords":"","body":"Installing on Apple (OS X)\nThis guide is for written for Mac users using Homebrew.\nInstall Dependencies\n\n# OpenSSL:\nbrew install openssl\nbrew link --force openssl\n\n# CMake:\nbrew install cmake\n\nPlease see the Linux instructions for other optional dependencies. \nInstall LibSourcey\ncd ~/tmp\ngit clone https://github.com/sourcey/libsourcey.git\ncd libsourcey\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake .. -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE # extra cmake commands here, see below for a full list...\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\n\n\n\nCompile with Xcode\n\nGenerate Xcode project using CMake, as described above.\nLaunch Xcode, locate and open libsourcey.xcodeproj.

Although LocalDateTime supports relational and arithmetic operators, all date/time comparisons and date/time arithmetics should be done in UTC, using the DateTime or Timestamp class for better performance. The relational operators normalize the dates/times involved to UTC before carrying out the comparison.\nThe time zone differential is based on the input date and time and current time zone. A number of constructors accept an explicit time zone differential parameter. These should not be used since daylight savings time processing is impossible since the time zone is unknown. Each of the constructors accepting a tzd parameter have been marked as deprecated and may be removed in a future revision.\nSummary\n\n\n\nMembers\nDescriptions                                \n\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime()\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(int year,int month,int day,int hour,int minute,int second,int millisecond,int microsecond)\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(int tzd,int year,int month,int day,int hour,int minute,int second,int millisecond,int microsecond)\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(constDateTime& dateTime)\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(int tzd,constDateTime& dateTime)\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(int tzd,constDateTime& dateTime,bool adjust)\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(double julianDay)\nCreates a LocalDateTime for the given Julian day in the local time zone.\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(int tzd,double julianDay)\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(constLocalDateTime& dateTime)\nCopy constructor.

Although LocalDateTime supports relational and arithmetic operators, all date/time comparisons and date/time arithmetics should be done in UTC, using the DateTime or Timestamp class for better performance. The relational operators normalize the dates/times involved to UTC before carrying out the comparison.\nThe time zone differential is based on the input date and time and current time zone. A number of constructors accept an explicit time zone differential parameter. These should not be used since daylight savings time processing is impossible since the time zone is unknown. Each of the constructors accepting a tzd parameter have been marked as deprecated and may be removed in a future revision.\nSummary\n\n\n\nMembers\nDescriptions                                \n\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime()\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(int year,int month,int day,int hour,int minute,int second,int millisecond,int microsecond)\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(int tzd,int year,int month,int day,int hour,int minute,int second,int millisecond,int microsecond)\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(constDateTime& dateTime)\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(int tzd,constDateTime& dateTime)\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(int tzd,constDateTime& dateTime,bool adjust)\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(double julianDay)\nCreates a LocalDateTime for the given Julian day in the local time zone.\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(int tzd,double julianDay)\n\n\n\npublic  LocalDateTime(constLocalDateTime& dateTime)\nCopy constructor.
