We still don’t know exactly ‘how’ the brain functions or stores information, but we do know how to program it to function at a higher level of efficiency. Within our skull resides an amazing super-computer; wouldn’t it be a shame if it wasn’t able to shine just because we didn’t learn the proper commands?</p> <p>The mind and body that understands the underlying principles of nature, can apply them to great effect to learning, thinking and application. The education system hasn’t done much for us in this regard, tending to cram our minds full of facts and figures, rather than teaching it about system, technique and strategy.</p> <h3 id=paradoxical-thinking>Paradoxical Thinking</h3> <p>Paradoxical thinking is an important element of learning that challenges us to look beyond the bounds of what is considered rational and therefore ‘valid’. Paradoxically, paradoxical arguments are generally considered to be ‘invalid’, but the true value lies in the ensuing conflict that demands to be resolved. </p> <ul> <li>yin yang and paradoxes <ul> <li>for most ideas that are considered to be true, there are generally polar opposites that are also considered to be true. This forms the basis ‘Yin Yang’, the Chinese belief that states that everything in nature has an opposite, otherwise it could not exist in the first place.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The mind processes information visually in the language of forms and shapes[], but the perception and meaning of this language is governed by conscious and unconscious patterns. Physicists, alchemists, philosophers and mathematicians, and more, all attempt to explain nature by reducing it into more understandable and manageable data sets. The good news is you don’t need a fancy degree, just strong will and a perceptive mind.</p> <p>Masters of their destiny will tell you that the human animal thrives under genuine adversity, with the constant guidance of the internal voice of opposition. For the weak-minded or uneducated that choose complacency and ignorance, their internal voice becomes nothing more than the constant whisper of self-loathing that drives self-destructive tendencies, and is eventually lost altogether. </p> <p>So how does one stay sane in a world full of contradictions and paradoxes?</p> <p>Physicists, alchemists, philosophers and mathematicians, and more, all attempt to explain nature by reducing it into more understandable and manageable data sets. The good news is you don’t need a fancy degree, just strong will and a perceptive mind.</p> <p>Every day we are bombarded with an insane amount of stimulus, and if we were consciously aware of it all at once, the we would surely go insane! The mind conveniently develops coping mechanisms that filter and sometimes modify non-critical and overly traumatic details and experiences. While these mechanisms are necessary, the process of desensitisation can dull the mind over time.</p> <p>An intelligent and active mind is defined by it’s ability to see directly to the core of the matter; either by way of empirical knowledge, or some unexplained primordial intuition[]. For now we’ll assume that knowledge is learned, and that anything else is outside of our direct control, therefore outside the scope of this article.</p> <p>– wu-gong? The first thing required is will-power, the will to constantly override the internal voice of opposition which wants to enforce your learned patterns. Will-power is developed though conflict, be it with the self, others or situational. The key to developing will-power, as well as most learned skills, is focus.</p> <h2 id=recognising-and-reprogramming-patterns>Recognising and Reprogramming Patterns</h2> <p>In nature, as well as the human mind, we can observe geometric patterns and principles that reoccur [sacred geometry]. As energy collides and interacts at the mercy of the variables and constants that comprise the laws of nature, it stands to reason that there will be convergent similarities. </p> <p>Patterns of the mind, both conscious and unconscious, govern the way we perceive sensory input and stored memories. In essence, reality doesn’t change, but the way we see it does. </p> <p>The practice of identifying and understanding the patterns that govern the mind is a worthy pursuit, especially when those patterns deprive us of our full potential. Limiting thought patterns are learned and enforced on us from birth by our parents, friends, work, and society as whole. Many of these patterns are so ingrained into every day life, that they are absurdly considered by everyone to be “normal”. The deeper you look into your own life and the world around you, the more the matrix of patterns that comprise perceived reality are exposed.</p> <p>The more patterns we take on board through life, the more disconnected we become from our source, and the less “free” we become. This metamorphosis prevents us from being able to express ourselves truly, and simply “be in the the moment”. Without patterns we would exist in a state of bliss, but the truth is that some patterns are necessary for our very survival, so it’s up to your discretion as to what you want to let go of, and keep. The important thing is to know that you have control over the process, the principle of neural plasticity[] ensures that nothing in our mind is ever fixed. </p> <h3 id=visualise>Visualise</h3> <p>First, calm your mind and relax your body - the deeper your mediative state the better.</p> <p>A system is both as simple and complex as the sum of all of its parts[], so start by visualising your life and consciousness as the overall system, and your patterns as the parts which comprise the whole. </p> <p>Just as mental patterns are constructs of consciousness, they can also be visualised as constructs in the form of shapes and emotions by the way they intersect and influence the energetic space in which they exist. The more you can isolate variables and constants which formulate the pattern, the clearer the pattern will become, and in turn it’s affect on your entire life.</p> <p>When you’re aware of your pattern and can visualise and it’s constructs, then you’re ready to make your peace and finally let it go.</p> <h3 id=accept>Accept</h3> <p>Enter into a meditative state again, and become aware consciously aware of the pattern that you want to let go of, and how it affects your mind and body. Explore all the parts of your pattern, including the journeys it has taken you on over the course of your life. Wherever this takes you just go with it, and weather you feel pain, fear, rage, or loss, just experience those feelings and allow them to be.</p> <p>Remember that resistance is futile; you can’t fight negativity with hatred or more negativity, this is about accepting and letting go. </p> <p>Before long you will feel clear again, like a weight has been lifted - but we’re not done yet! When you’ve accepted your pattern, and dealt with the associated negative feeling and emotions, you’re ready to override your original programming.</p> <h3 id=override>Override</h3> <p>Overriding your original programming is as simple as doing something that’s completely contradictory to your original programming. The more you do it the better. Have fun, and above all, be outrageous. This is, after all, about breaking patterns and limitations!</p> <h2 id=wu-gong-masters>Wu-Gong Masters</h2> <p>Gong fu masters are the true masters of reality, for have connected the mind to the the body in a way that enables them to achieve seemingly super-human feats.</p> <p>Most of us have mapped our neural pathways sufficiently to be able to preform daily functions with ease, but what if your brain was mapped to accelerate and project your entire body mass through any movement? This kind of ability may seem improbable and even impossible to some, and I would probably tend to agree had I not witnessed such feats first hand.</p> <p>In martial arts we can observe two predominant philosophies; one that favours the hard (external), and one that favours the soft (internal). Internal martial arts that focus on how to maximise force with minimal effort are of particular interest to me, because they show the existence of a not commonly understood force that can’t be generated by muscular exertion alone. </p> <p>This ‘special’ force moves through the human body, and can be demonstrated by a few top masters at will. I’m talking about the kind of condition that allows a mother to lift up a car to rescue her baby[].</p> <p>Chu Shong Tin is an amazing example, not only is he is one of the great internal gong fu masters, but he has the internal control to cycle his heart rate at will - though all … pulses measured in Chinese medicine.</p> <p>Those who spend a lot of time in their mind often neglect the body, but it’s through the combination of mind, body and what we subjectively call spirit, that true intelligence can be attained.</p> <h2 id=what-are-you-waiting-for>What Are You Waiting For</h2> <p>It’s always easier to tweak an operational system that it is to build one from scratch, so what are you waiting for? Start re-programing yourself to be a better you by breaking the rules that society and you have set for yourself. At best people will think you’re a savant, and at worst they’ll think you’re an idiot, maybe a little of both, but remember that everything that’s considered normal today was outrageous and preposterous at one point in time, so who gives a shit what people think anyway!?</p> <h2 class=no_toc id=attribution>Attribution</h2> <ol> <li> <a href="#banner">DMT</a> by <a href="//studiofeng.net">Alice Feng</a> </li> </ol> </body></html> </div> </div> <div class="large-3 columns"> <div class=sidebar> <div class="sidebar-section toc"> <h4 class=no_toc id=contents>Contents</h4> <ul id=markdown-toc> <li><a href="#paradoxical-thinking">Paradoxical Thinking</a></li> <li> <a href="#recognising-and-reprogramming-patterns">Recognising and Reprogramming Patterns</a> <ul> <li><a href="#visualise">Visualise</a></li> <li><a href="#accept">Accept</a></li> <li><a href="#override">Override</a></li> </ul> </li> <li><a href="#wu-gong-masters">Wu-Gong Masters</a></li> <li><a href="#what-are-you-waiting-for">What Are You Waiting For</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="sidebar-section tags"> <h4>Tags</h4> <ul><li><a href="/tags/psychology/">Psychology</a></li><li><a href="/tags/philosophy/">Philosophy</a></li></ul> </div> </div> </div> <ul class=social-buttons> <li> <a href="//twitter.com/share" class="socialite twitter-share" data-text="Engineering the Mind" data-url="http://sourcey.com/engineering-the-mind/" data-count=vertical rel=nofollow target=_blank><span class=vhidden>Share on Twitter</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://sourcey.com/engineering-the-mind/" class="socialite googleplus-one" data-size=tall data-href="//sourcey.com/engineering-the-mind/" rel=nofollow target=_blank><span class=vhidden>Share on Google+</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://sourcey.com/engineering-the-mind/&amp;t=Engineering the Mind" class="socialite facebook-like" data-href="http://sourcey.com/engineering-the-mind/" data-send=false data-layout=box_count data-width=60 data-show-faces=false rel=nofollow target=_blank><span class=vhidden>Share on Facebook</span></a> </li> <li> <a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=http://sourcey.com/engineering-the-mind/&amp;title=Engineering the Mind" class="socialite linkedin-share" data-url="http://sourcey.com/engineering-the-mind/" data-counter=top rel=nofollow target=_blank><span class=vhidden>Share on LinkedIn</span></a> </li> </ul> <article> <div id=disqus_thread></div> <script>
