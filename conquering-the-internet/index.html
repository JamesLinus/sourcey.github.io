      <h1 id="conquering-the-internet">Conquering the Internet</h1>

<p>Everyone with an entrepreneurial spark is trying to claim their piece of Internet glory, yet only a select few will have any measure of success. </p>

<p>When a warlord conquers a country, he not only does so with supreme force of will, he does so with an army. Despite his brutality, the warlords also has a certain kind of honour. The Internet differs from the battlefield in this respect, because of the enormous potential for cloak and dagger. In this brave new world of Internet marketing, it's the Internet warrior who succeeds with honour and dignity who's the real victor.</p>

<!--
To conquer the Internet is a dream held by many, yet its easy to forget what's important along the treacherous path to victory. 
, and what you will have to give and take.
-->

<h2 id="meditation">Meditation</h2>

<p>Before you set out your hero's journey, you would be well served to calm and prepare your mind for what's coming. It's easy to be blinded by the entrepreneurial fervour, so most have unrealistic expectations of success. Make sure you know what you're in for, and that you're willing to accept the long term effects and responsibilities of your undertaking. </p>

<p>Take the time to detach yourself, and view your goals with an objective and critical mind. Ask yourself the difficult questions, and if you can't be 100% honest, then find someone who will.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do I have the manpower and resources?</li>
  <li>Have I researched the market properly?</li>
  <li>Is my project worthy of financial investment?</li>
  <li>Am I ready to spend the next few years doing this?</li>
  <li>Have I spoken to the right people?</li>
</ul>

<p>In this world full by quick fix pop culture and black-hat morals, genuine quality has become something of a rarity. Stay true to your purpose, don't be guiled into believing the hollow promises and hype, and eventually you will cultivate a loyal and credible following. What's rare is also valuable. Your success won't be instantaneous, but it will be hard earned and well rewarded. </p>

<h2 id="building-your-castle">Building your Castle</h2>

<p>In the game of the Internet, you should first concentrate on building your castle, which your primary domain.</p>

<p>Forget about the crappy minisites and backlink spam - shortcuts will get you killed. You are establishing an online economy and you don't want to spread yourself thin with too many towns and villages early on in the piece. Consolidate your resources, and focus on your primary domain.</p>

<h2 id="rallying-the-troops">Rallying the Troops</h2>

<p>To consolidate your vision, you need to rally the troops. Working as a solopreneur is a tough gig - so why not make life easy on yourself? The Internet is a hive of people, and everyone is looking for something, so why not use it to connect with people! Check meetup.com for local meetups with people of similar interests. Talk about and develop your ideas with other people, and pretty soon your talent, conviction and passion will begin to attract an army.</p>

<p>A warlord rallies his troops with fear and promise of spoils untold, but as entrepreneurs preffer to offer each other friendship and success.</p>

<p>Some good places are Meetup, Facebook, Github - whatever floats your boat.</p>

<h2 id="going-to-war">Going to War</h2>

<p>On the Internet, the success is measured in terms of conversions, revenue and real estate. Total annihilation of the competition is just a bonus!</p>

<p>Developing a sound Marketing Strategy and sticking to is key, as well as knowing how to use the Internet as a weapon.</p>

<p>Without going into extreme detail, here are some factors to consider when educating yourself and planning your strategy.</p>

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>

<p>Google's algorithm changes have made it easier than ever to rank for genuine quality original content, so get writing! Write natural content covering all aspects of your market and profession. Careful not to repost or duplicate your content on other sites. Guest post if you have to, but remember, <strong>your</strong> content is always more valuable on <strong>YOUR</strong> domain.</p>

<p>Because of this, it follows that you should store your blog of your own domain. Try to stay clear of cloud blogging platforms (Wordpress/Tumblr) for your primary content, but by all means use them to aggregate excerpts from your blog feed.</p>

<h3 id="social-media">Social Media</h3>

<p>Social media mastery is vital to your online success. Learn to balance the right amount of interaction and automation to ensure rapid growth. </p>

<p>Using and understanding the right tools for the job will save you precious time. Tools you should be using are: <a href="http://bufferapp.com" title="Buffer" target="_blank">Buffer</a> to automate your content syndication, and <a href="http://gardn.net" title="Gardn" target="_blank">Gardn</a> to ensure your content is shared far and wide via your social networks.</p>

<h3 id="seo">SEO</h3>

<p>Things are changing fast in the SEO world, so it's a good idea to stay informed about the latest SEO trends - just don't caught up in the hype.</p>

<p>Spend time creating regular content and reputable backlinks, and be sure to optimize your site for page speed and cross platform devices. Educate yourself about static websites (Middleman, Jekyll), and responsive design (Bootstrap, Zerb Foundation), and use pretty URLs wherever possible.</p>

<h3 id="advertising">Advertising</h3>

<p>Your best source of traffic is going to be organic search traffic, so pool your resources and focus on the search engines. If you have the budget for it, then by all means advertise the best of your content and products.</p>

<p>PPC advertising is expensive, and can be hit and miss depending on your product and presentation. The best success I have had is with more expensive items due to the increased the conversion ratio.</p>

<p>You might also consider paid directories. DMOZ is free but hard to get in, and Best of the Web and Yahoo are well known paid directories. Directories will give you credibility, but bear in mind they aren't cheap, and many consider them to be redundant.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-for-victory">Preparing for Victory</h2>
<p>The way one handles victory says a lot about the character of a person or business. You may be tempted by the bright lights and fat stacks, but in the end the greatest reward you can expect is to succeed while having a good time and conducting yourself with integrity.</p>

<p>The victor has certain obligations, least of which is to set the standard for those to come. As your business grows, so must you. Be consistent with your training, meditation and relaxation, and free yourself from gloating and arrogant expression. Keep developing your mind and body so that your endeavours may continue to evolve alongside your vision and creativity.</p>
